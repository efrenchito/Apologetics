@1.What is the Bible made of?
  Isn't just one book written by one person.
  Is a collection of 66 books/39 old testament|27 new testament
  It's written over a period of 16hundred years by more than 14 authors (kings/diplomates/poor people/fisher man/tend maker)
  3 Languages  -> Hebrew/Arameek/Greek/
  3 Continents -> Asia/Africa/Europe

  Now wen ask about the integrity of any ancient written is determined by a number of things:
  - The number of documented/fragment manuscripts that we have to examine
  + The time difference between when the original was written and when a survival piece of this still exist
    - Platon oldest copy 1400 years after it was originally written
    - Sofocles 193 ancient copies of this manuscript but the earliest copy 1400 years afther it was originally written
    - Aristofones 10 copies survive but the earliest copy 1200 years
    - New Testament 30.000 copies the earliest copy decades
      -> Where were the gospels written? 
        The 4 Gospels were written outside the land of the stories they talk about Israel-Judea
        Mark->Rome
        Luke->"Antioquie"
        John->Efeso
        Mathew->Judea
      -> Do the writters could the ??? the right thing?

@2.Can we really trust what it says?
@3.What about the miracles
